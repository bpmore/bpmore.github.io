This post started from a conversation with 2 of my best friends. One was passing along information on a guitar for sale. In short, the seller was asking retail price or more for his used gear.

## The price is the price?

One way to determine the price of gear is to search [Reverb](https://reverb.com/shop/brents-gear-locker-58). Folks fail when they see a price and think:

> This is how much my guitar is worth!

Easy peasy, right? Right? Right?

Stop looking at Reverb and thinking the price is the price. It's not.

## How to find the price of your gear.

### Step 1

Search Reverb for the item you're wanting to sell.

### Step 2

Filter your search to show only sold items.

### Step 3

Sort the results so that you see the most recent sales first. This gives you a better idea of the current value of your item.

### Step 4

Do the math.

[Reverb says their pricing is straightforward](https://reverb.com/selling/selling-fees).

Math makes my head hurt so I just take 10 to 15% off the sold price.

If the seller offered free shipping, also subtract that from the sold price. For a guitar, subtract an additional $80 or more.

The result is a good estimate of what your selling price should be.

They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother

Each Dismal Ax guitar is as unique as their creator. These are works of art.

Lewis Guitars makes the Revealer, Ad√©lie and the Minnow. Owning any one of these would be fine by me!

The 1129 is Sturner Guitars flagship model. They are made in Philly and James videos on social media showing his processes are awesome to watch. He also has an international series and I would be happy to start with an Int'l 1129 as my first Sturner Guitar.

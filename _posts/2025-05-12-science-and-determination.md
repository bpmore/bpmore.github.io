## My body is a science fair project.

In 2018, I was overweight (around 260+ pounds) but stayed active, helping a friend remodel their house. Partway through, I began struggling to breathe deeply. After several doctor visits, including a lung MRI that showed no issues, a technician spotted an abnormality in my heart. My lower anterior descending artery (LAD), known as "The Widowmaker," was completely blocked. Miraculously, tiny collateral pathways had formed around the blockage, keeping me alive. I now have two stents and a story to share.

After my heart work, I started working out and making an effort to stay active and then 2020 hit.

### October 2020
- **A1c**: 7.3% (high, normal <7.0%)
- **Weight**: 250 lb.
- **Context**: Early indication of prediabetes/early type 2 diabetes. No GLP-1/GIP agonists or Metformin noted.

### April 2021
- **A1c**: 6.5% (normal <7.0%, but high for stricter ranges like 4.0–6.0%)
- **Weight**: 250 lb.
- **Context**: Improved A1c.

In 2021, I weighed around 245–250 pounds, wore XXL shirts, and had a 38–40-inch waist. I developed severe shoulder pain, barely able to move my arm. An X-ray revealed a minor rotator cuff tear. Physical therapy didn’t help, and my therapist asked if I had diabetes. I wasn’t sure, but a physical the following week showed my A1c at 7.3, indicating diabetes. My doctor prescribed a low dose of Metformin. Within a week, my shoulder inflammation decreased, allowing me to start effective rehabilitation.

### October 2021
- **A1c**: 7.0% (borderline, normal <7.0%)
- **Weight**: 250 lb.
- **Metformin**: Started at 500 mg daily with breakfast.
- **Context**: A1c fluctuated, still indicating poor control.

### April 2022
- **A1c**: 7.4% (high, normal <7.0%)
- **Weight**: 250 lb.
- **Metformin**: 500 mg daily with breakfast.
- **Context**: Worsening A1c, suggesting need for intervention.

In 2022, my A1c levels kept rising. In October, I began taking Mounjaro, which cost $25 a month for a year through a promotion. Over that year, I lost about 50 pounds, going from XXL to size L shirts and from a 38–40-inch to a 34-inch waist. Mounjaro kickstarted my weight loss, improving how my body felt. Feeling better motivated me to be more active, which led to further weight loss. This sparked a mental reset, prompting me to cut out sugar, adopt a low-calorie diet, and maintain healthier eating habits.

### October 2022
- **A1c**: 7.6% (high, normal <7.0%)
- **Weight**: 245 lb.
- **Mounjaro**: Started at 2.5 mg weekly.
- **Metformin**: 1000 mg twice daily.
- **Context**: Annual exam. Mounjaro initiated for glycemic control and weight loss due to high A1c and overweight status.

### April 2023
- **A1c**: 5.1% (normal, <7.0%)
- **Weight**: 215 lb.
- **Mounjaro**: Continued (increased to 7.5 mg, per titration plan).
- **Metformin**: Continued.
- **Context**: Significant A1c drop (7.6% to 5.1% in 6 months), due to Mounjaro, Metformin, and cardio exercise.

### October 2023
- **A1c**: 5.2% (normal, <7.0%)
- **Weight**: 195 lb.
- **Mounjaro**: Stopped (~1 year of use, stopped due to insurance non-coverage).
- **Metformin**: Continued.
- **Context**: A1c stable, but Mounjaro discontinued. Metformin and lifestyle maintained control.

In the six months after stopping Mounjaro in 2023, I faced challenges as my appetite returned. For the first time in a year, I felt hunger and craved food, eating a lot of peanut M&Ms. This led to a quick 10-pound weight gain, but I stabilized at 205–210 pounds. I continued daily cardio and worked on adapting to hunger. In April 2024, I began taking Ozempic to manage my weight and health.

### April 2024
- **Ozempic**: Started.
- **Metformin**: Continued.
- **Context**: Ozempic initiated due to insurance coverage, maintaining A1c and weight loss post-Mounjaro.

### May 2024
- **A1c**: 5.3% (normal, <7.0%)
- **Weight**: 208 lb.
- **Ozempic**: 1 mg weekly, replaced 0.5 mg dose.
- **Metformin**: 1000 mg twice daily with meals.
- **Context**: A1c slightly higher but normal. Weight loss evident (245 lb to 208 lb). Ozempic and Metformin supporting control.

In May and June 2024, I adopted a ketogenic diet, eliminating all sugar. I stopped focusing on structured workouts but stayed active by spending time outdoors whenever possible. I prioritized quality time with family and friends, maintaining an active and balanced lifestyle.

### July 2024
- **Weight**: 195 lb.
- **Mounjaro**: Stopped.
- **Ozempic**: Continued at 1 mg weekly.
- **Metformin**: Continued at 1000 mg twice daily.
- **Context**: Further weight loss (208 lb to 195 lb).

In September 2024, I eliminated Diet Coke and coffee, switching to water and adding electrolytes as needed. I continued the ketogenic diet, avoiding all sugars, though I rarely use Allulose as a sweetener. I started weight training, incorporated occasional cardio, and increased my protein intake to over 120 grams daily. My protein drinks now include:

- Raw Nutrition Isolate Protein Dark Chocolate (get it at Sam’s Club)
- Benefiber (2x dose)
- Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides (also at Sam’s Club)

This has replaced coffee and become my morning ritual.

I’ve found an affordable, high-protein lunch option at Wendy’s: meat patties ($1.35 each) and cheese slices ($0.40 each), providing 60–80 grams of protein for under $5. For dinner, I eat shrimp, fish, or chicken with broccoli or green beans. Sticking to a consistent routine has been key. I no longer track calories as I did while on Mounjaro, instead trusting my ketogenic process. I monitor ketosis with a Keto-Mojo glucose and ketone meter and practice 36-hour fasts every 3–4 weeks. I now fit into my son’s medium-sized shirts and wear pants with a 30–32-inch waist.

### November 2024
- **A1c**: 5.0% (normal, <7.0%)
- **Weight**: 190 lb.
- **Mounjaro**: Stopped.
- **Ozempic**: 2 mg weekly.
- **Metformin**: Continued at 1000 mg twice daily.
- **Context**: A1c reached target 5.0%. Weight loss continued.

### May 2025
- **A1c**: 4.8% (normal, <7.0%)
- **Weight**: 172 lb.
- **Ozempic**: 2 mg weekly.
- **Metformin**: Continued at 1000 mg.
- **Context**: Best A1c recorded, significant weight loss (245 lb to 172 lb).

Since the 2024 election, I’ve focused on living in the present, practicing gratitude, and minimizing social media use. With my parents and children growing older, I want to prioritize time with them, not spent on my iPhone. After surviving a major heart issue, I see my life as a second chance and am committed to being the best version of me that I can be. I also want to spend more time playing guitar instead of acquiring gear...I type as I'm looking at the box containing my new [JHS Notadumble](https://jhspedals.info/products/notadumble).

My next steps are to create a full-body workout routine I can do anywhere and add more yoga to my routine. I have chronic lower back pain, which I believe I can improve with stretching and chiropractic care. I take daily pain medication and aim to reduce or stop using it. I want more defined arms and stronger legs, with the goal of standing up from a seated position without using my hands. I feel like a living science experiment, enjoying the challenge of earning my "blue ribbon".

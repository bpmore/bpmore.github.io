# Why Sully Guitars Are Exceptional: A Deep Dive into Craftsmanship and Innovation

## A Legacy Built by Rock & Roll
Sully Guitars, founded by Jon "Sully" Sullivan, embodies the spirit of rock and roll with a commitment to crafting high-performance instruments. From his early days modding guitars as a teenager to establishing Sully Guitars as a full-time venture in 2014, Sullivan’s passion for guitar building shines through. Each guitar is a testament to his lifelong dedication to refining designs and pushing the boundaries of playability and aesthetics. With models played everywhere from bedrooms to Coachella, Sully Guitars has earned a reputation for delivering instruments that inspire musicians worldwide.[](https://www.sullyguitars.com/story)

## Unmatched Customization for Every Player
One of the standout features of Sully Guitars is their deep customization options, particularly in the USA Custom Series. Whether you’re dreaming of a specific wood combination, hardware, or finish, Sully Guitars ensures your instrument is uniquely yours. From the ergonomic “instant friend” neck profile to premium materials like roasted maple or flamed English walnut, every detail is tailored to fit the player like a well-worn pair of jeans. The detailed custom quote forms on their website make it easy to spec out your dream guitar, ensuring a personalized experience from start to finish.[](https://www.sullyguitars.com)

## The Conspiracy Series: Affordable Excellence
Introduced in 2018, the Conspiracy Series brings Sully’s signature designs to a broader audience without compromising quality. Built in South Korea to Sullivan’s exact specifications and inspected at Sully HQ in Texas, these guitars feature premium components like stainless steel frets, locking tuners, and custom-wound pickups. Models like the ‘71 Trella and 624 PME offer high-end performance at a more accessible price point, making them ideal for musicians seeking professional-grade instruments that won’t break the bank.[](https://www.sullyguitars.com/run-8)

## Innovative Design for Modern Players
Sully Guitars prioritizes playability and stability, evident in models like the ‘71, which reimagines the singlecut guitar with modern enhancements. Features such as compound radius fretboards (12-16”), jumbo stainless steel frets, and dual-action truss rods ensure effortless playability and tuning stability. The ‘71 Trella LS, with its 24.75” scale length, blends classic aesthetics with contemporary performance, while options like Floyd Rose bridges cater to players who demand precision for aggressive styles.[](https://www.sullyguitars.com/sully71)

## Premium Materials and Craftsmanship
Every Sully guitar is crafted with meticulous attention to material selection and construction. Woods like korina, mahogany, and ebony are paired with high-end hardware, such as Hipshot locking tuners and TonePros bridges, to deliver exceptional tone and durability. The use of Luminlay side dots and Graph Tech TUSQ nuts enhances functionality, while PLEK technology ensures flawless fretwork. These elements combine to create instruments that not only sound incredible but also stand up to the rigors of live performance.[](https://www.sullyguitars.com/available-stock)

## Signature Pickups for Versatile Tones
Sully Guitars’ Conspiracy Series pickups, like the Secret Menu and Salty Bastard, are wound to Sullivan’s specs and offer a range of tonal possibilities. From the hot PAF-style Secret Menu to the flamethrowing JardinAir, these pickups deliver everything from clean clarity to searing leads. Options for Alnico 5, Alnico 8, or ceramic magnets, along with coil-splitting controls, provide versatility for any genre. For those seeking USA-made pickups, upgrades are available to match the Custom Series’ premium electronics.[](https://www.sullyguitars.com/available-stock)

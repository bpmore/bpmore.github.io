# Why Lucky Dog Guitars Are a Cut Above the Rest

Nestled in the rolling foothills of eastern Tennessee, Lucky Dog Guitars has carved out a reputation for crafting exceptional, handbuilt instruments that resonate with musicians and collectors alike. Founded by luthier Anthony Sims, this small workshop embodies the spirit of artisanal craftsmanship, producing guitars that are as unique as the players who wield them. With a commitment to quality, individuality, and Tennessee pride, Lucky Dog Guitars stands out in a world of mass-produced instruments. Here’s why these guitars are truly special.

## A Legacy Born from Passion

Lucky Dog Guitars began with a simple desire: to create the perfect guitar. After decades of playing in bands and growing frustrated with the limitations of affordable instruments, Anthony Sims took matters into his own hands. In 1981, inspired by the raw energy of Chuck Berry, Sims began his musical journey, eventually leading him to build his first Telecaster-style guitar. That creation, the Lucky Dog Televangelist, named after his dog and his love for soulful music, sparked a movement. Musicians at local gigs took notice, and soon, orders started pouring in from around the world.[](https://jedistar.com/lucky-dog-guitars/)

## Handcrafted, One at a Time

Unlike factory-produced guitars, every Lucky Dog instrument is built individually, with meticulous attention to detail. Sims treats each guitar as a singular work of art, often spending 4 to 8 weeks on a single build, with an additional 20-30 hours dedicated to visual finishing. This hands-on approach ensures that no two guitars are alike, offering players an instrument that’s truly one-of-a-kind. For musicians who value exclusivity, a Lucky Dog guitar is a statement of individuality.[](https://www.accessbagsandcases.com/profile-lucky-dog/)

## Premium Materials, No Compromises

Lucky Dog Guitars uses only the highest quality materials, from carefully selected tonewoods to custom-wound pickups. For example, their Televangelist model features a flamed maple compound radius neck and premium pickups like the RC Blacktie bridge and RC ’59 Bloodline neck. Unlike mass-produced guitars that rely on standard-grade components, Lucky Dog sources the best wood and hardware, ensuring superior playability and tone. This dedication to quality elevates their instruments above the competition.[](https://reverb.com/item/7450836-lucky-dog-televangelist-custom-relic-aged-telecaster-tele-guitar-gatorskin-embossed-teardrop-case)

## Custom Hardware for Unmatched Performance

Every Lucky Dog guitar is equipped with custom-machined hardware, designed to enhance both aesthetics and functionality. From titanium saddles to bespoke pickups crafted by artisans as far away as Greece, these components are chosen to deliver exceptional sound and durability. This focus on custom hardware means that each guitar not only looks stunning but also performs flawlessly, whether on stage or in the studio.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l4gNaoFV20)

## Tennessee Pride in Every Build

The phrase “Barn Built - With Tennessee Pride” isn’t just a slogan—it’s a philosophy. Lucky Dog Guitars embodies the spirit of eastern Tennessee, where hard work, tradition, and craftsmanship converge. Built in a small workshop in Cleveland, Tennessee, each guitar carries the soul of the region, appealing to players who appreciate the authenticity and heart of American-made instruments. This regional pride resonates with musicians worldwide, from local artists to global collectors.[](https://jedistar.com/lucky-dog-guitars/)

## A Favorite Among Touring Artists

Lucky Dog Guitars has earned the trust of world-touring musicians who demand reliability and excellence. The company’s commitment to creating instruments with superior playability and tone has made them a go-to choice for professionals. Extensive reviews and customer feedback on platforms like their Facebook page highlight the satisfaction of owners, many of whom praise the guitars’ ability to stand up to the rigors of live performance.

## Uncompromising Attention to Detail

What sets Lucky Dog apart is its obsessive focus on the finer points. Sims spends over 100 hours on the visual detailing of some guitars, ensuring that every curve, finish, and relic effect is perfect. This level of care extends to the playability, with features like medium C-profile necks and compound radius fretboards designed for comfort and precision. For players who notice the small things, a Lucky Dog guitar feels like an extension of their creativity.[](https://reverb.com/item/7450836-lucky-dog-televangelist-custom-relic-aged-telecaster-tele-guitar-gatorskin-embossed-teardrop-case)

## A Global Community of Players

From its humble beginnings, Lucky Dog Guitars has grown into a global phenomenon, with instruments in nearly every state and country. The company fosters a tight-knit community of players and collectors through its newsletter, social media, and events like Facebook giveaways. By sharing new builds and engaging with fans, Lucky Dog creates a sense of belonging, making owners feel like part of an exclusive family. This connection adds an emotional value to their guitars that’s hard to find elsewhere.[](https://www.youtube.com/%40luckydogcustomguitars2031)

## Exclusivity Through Limited Production

Sims deliberately keeps production small, crafting only 15-20 guitars a year. This limited output allows him to maintain uncompromising quality while keeping the process a passion-driven hobby rather than a mass-production operation. For collectors, this exclusivity is a major draw—owning a Lucky Dog guitar means possessing a rare piece of craftsmanship that won’t be replicated. It’s a refreshing antidote to the homogeneity of big-brand guitars.[](https://www.accessbagsandcases.com/profile-lucky-dog/)

## Innovative Designs That Stand Out

Lucky Dog Guitars isn’t afraid to push boundaries. Models like the Dirty Domino and the Buckhorn Saloon showcase bold aesthetics, from relic finishes to unique color bursts like Sweet Sugar Mint and Classic Cherry. These designs, paired with thoughtful features like gatorskin-embossed cases, make each guitar a visual and sonic masterpiece. For players who want to stand out on stage, Lucky Dog offers instruments that demand attention.[](https://www.reddit.com/user/LuckyDogGuitars/)

## Accessible Through Multiple Platforms

Lucky Dog Guitars makes it easy for fans to explore their work. Their official website (https://luckydogguitars.store) showcases available guitars, accessories, and merchandise, while their Etsy shop offers handmade leather straps and other gear. Social media platforms like YouTube, Reddit, and Facebook provide demos, customer reviews, and updates on new builds. This multi-channel presence ensures that players and collectors can connect with the brand, no matter where they are.[](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1110858126/lucky-dog-elite-handcrafted-handmade)

## A Legacy of Saying “No” to Boring Guitars

Lucky Dog Guitars lives by the mantra “Just Say No To Boring Guitars.” This philosophy drives their mission to create instruments that inspire and excite. Whether it’s the soulful twang of a Televangelist or the bold aesthetics of a custom build, every Lucky Dog guitar is designed to spark creativity and joy. For musicians seeking an instrument with personality and soul, Lucky Dog Guitars is the ultimate choice.[](https://www.youtube.com/%40luckydogcustomguitars2031)
